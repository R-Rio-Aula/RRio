## Git / Github [Andrew]

### Explain Git and Github

* Git is a version control software for keeping track of changes made to your documents and allowing you to go to earlier versions of them
* Git removes the need for scripts labeled `model1`, `model2`, and so on...
* Github is a website that provides an interface for Git so that you can share and collaborate on projects

Once we have Git working on everyone's computers, we will be able to share the course notes together

### Install Git

### Connect Git to RStudio

http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/11/using-github-with-r-and-rstudio/

### Create Github accounts

### Create a Github repository

### Load a remote Github repository to the computer

### Push and pull things

### Collaboration? e.g. send pull requests, open issues, etc.

## Review exercise (end of Git class if there is time)

Suppose you want to know 

Something using functions and plots

## Control flow (day 4)

Often when we're coding we want to control the flow of our actions. This can be done
by setting actions to occur only if a condition or a set of conditions are met.
Alternatively, we can also set an action to occur a particular number of times.

There are several ways you can control flow in R.
For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the constructs:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# if
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}

# if ... else
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
```

Say, for example, that we want R to print a message if a variable `x` has a particular value:

```{r}
# sample a random number from a Poisson distribution
# with a mean (lambda) of 8

x <- rpois(1, lambda=8)

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
}

x
```

Note you may not get the same output as your neighbour because
you may be sampling different random numbers from the same distribution.

Let's set a seed so that we all generate the same 'pseudo-random'
number, and then print more information:

```{r}
x <- rpois(1, lambda=8)

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

> #### Tip: pseudo-random numbers {.callout}
>
> In the above case, the function `rpois` generates a random number following a
> Poisson distribution with a mean (i.e. lambda) of 8. The function `set.seed`
> guarantees that all machines will generate the exact same 'pseudo-random'

> So if we `set.seed(10)`, we see that `x` takes the value 8. You should get the
> exact same number.
>

**Important:** when R evaluates the condition inside `if` statements, it is
looking for a logical element, i.e., `TRUE` or `FALSE`. This can cause some
headaches for beginners. For example:

```{r}
x  <-  4 == 3
if (x) {
  "4 equals 3"
}
```

As we can see, the message was not printed because the vector x is `FALSE`

```{r}
x <- 4 == 3
x
```

> Now do the same for 2012.
>

Did anyone get a warning message like this?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (gapminder$year == 2012) {}
```

If your condition evaluates to a vector with more than one logical element,
the function `if` will still run, but will only evaluate the condition in the first
element. Here you need to make sure your condition is of length 1.

> This can be used in a similar way to the `%in%` operator.
> The function `all`, as the name suggests, will only return `TRUE` if all values in
> the vector are `TRUE`.

### Repeating operations

If you want to iterate over
a set of values, when the order of iteration is important, and perform the
same operation on each, a `for` loop will do the job.
We saw `for` loops in the shell lessons earlier. This is the most
flexible of looping operations, but therefore also the hardest to use
correctly. Avoid using `for` loops unless the order of iteration is important:
i.e. the calculation at each iteration depends on the results of previous iterations.

The basic structure of a `for` loop is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(iterator in set of values){
  do a thing
}
```

For example:

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  print(i)
}
```

The `1:10` bit creates a vector on the fly; you can iterate
over any other vector as well.

We can use a `for` loop nested within another `for` loop to iterate over two things at
once.

```{r}
for (i in 1:5){
  for(j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')){
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
```

Rather than printing the results, we could write the loop output to a new object.

```{r}
output_vector <- c()
for (i in 1:5){
  for(j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')){
    temp_output <- paste(i, j)
    output_vector <- c(output_vector, temp_output)
  }
}
output_vector
```

This approach can be useful, but 'growing your results' (building
the result object incrementally) is computationally inefficient, so avoid
it when you are iterating through a lot of values.

A better way is to define your (empty) output object before filling in the values.
For this example, it looks more involved, but is still more efficient.

```{r}
output_matrix <- matrix(nrow=5, ncol=5)
j_vector <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
for (i in 1:5){
  for(j in 1:5){
    temp_j_value <- j_vector[j]
    temp_output <- paste(i, temp_j_value)
    output_matrix[i, j] <- temp_output
  }
}
output_vector2 <- as.vector(output_matrix)
output_vector2
```

## Refresh on packages: what they are and how to install them

## plyr

Previously we looked at how you can use functions to simplify your code.
We defined the `calcGDP` function, which takes the gapminder dataset,
and multiplies the population and GDP per capita column. We also defined
additional arguments so we could filter by `year` and `country`:

```{r}
# Takes a dataset and multiplies the population column
# with the GDP per capita column.
calcGDP <- function(dat, year=NULL, country=NULL) {
  if(!is.null(year)) {
    dat <- dat[dat$year %in% year, ]
  }
  if (!is.null(country)) {
    dat <- dat[dat$country %in% country,]
  }
  gdp <- dat$pop * dat$gdpPercap

  new <- cbind(dat, gdp=gdp)
  return(new)
}
```

A common task you'll encounter when working with data, is that you'll want to
run calculations on different groups within the data. In the above, we were
simply calculating the GDP by multiplying two columns together. But what if
we wanted to calculated the mean GDP per continent?

We could run `calcGPD` and then take the mean of each continent:

```{r}
withGDP <- calcGDP(gapminder)
mean(withGDP[withGDP$continent == "Africa", "gdp"])
mean(withGDP[withGDP$continent == "Americas", "gdp"])
mean(withGDP[withGDP$continent == "Asia", "gdp"])
```

But this isn't very *nice*. Yes, by using a function, you have reduced a
substantial amount of repetition. That **is** nice. But there is still
repetition. Repeating yourself will cost you time, both now and later, and
potentially introduce some nasty bugs.

We could write a new function that is flexible like `calcGDP`, but this
also takes a substantial amount of effort and testing to get right.

The abstract problem we're encountering here is know as "split-apply-combine":

![Split apply combine](fig/splitapply.png)

We want to *split* our data into groups, in this case continents, *apply*
some calculations on that group, then optionally *combine* the results
together afterwards.

#### The `plyr` package

For those of you who have used R before, you might be familiar with the
`apply` family of functions. While R's built in functions do work, we're
going to introduce you to another method for solving the "split-apply-combine"
problem. The [plyr](http://had.co.nz/plyr/) package provides a set of
functions that we find more user friendly for solving this problem.

We installed this package in an earlier challenge. Let's load it now:

```{r}
library(plyr)
```

Plyr has functions for operating on `lists`, `data.frames` and `arrays`
(matrices, or n-dimensional vectors). Each function performs:

1. A **split**ting operation
2. **Apply** a function on each split in turn.
3. Re**combine** output data as a single data object.

The functions are named based on the data structure they expect as input,
and the data structure you want returned as output: [a]rray, [l]ist, or
[d]ata.frame. The first letter corresponds to the input data structure,
the second letter to the output data structure, and then the rest of the
function is named "ply".

This gives us 9 core functions **ply.  There are an additional three functions
which will only perform the split and apply steps, and not any combine step.
They're named by their input data type and represent null output by a `_` (see
table)

Note here that plyr's use of "array" is different to R's,
an array in ply can include a vector or matrix.

![Full apply suite](fig/full_apply_suite.png)


Each of the xxply functions (`daply`, `ddply`, `llply`, `laply`, ...) has the
same structure and has 4 key features and structure:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
xxply(.data, .variables, .fun)
```

* The first letter of the function name gives the input type and the second gives the output type.
* .data - gives the data object to be processed
* .variables - identifies the splitting variables
* .fun - gives the function to be called on each piece

Now we can quickly calculate the mean GDP per continent:

``` {r}
ddply(
 .data = calcGDP(gapminder),
 .variables = "continent",
 .fun = function(x) mean(x$gdp)
)
```

Let's walk through what just happened:

- The `ddply` function feeds in a `data.frame` (function starts with **d**) and
returns another `data.frame` (2nd letter is a **d**) i
- the first argument we gave was the data.frame we wanted to operate on: in this
  case the gapminder data. We called `calcGDP` on it first so that it would have
  the additional `gdp` column added to it.
- The second argument indicated our split criteria: in this case the "continent"
  column. Note that we just gave the name of the column, not the actual column
  itself like we've done previously with subsetting. Plyr takes care of these
  implementation details for you.
- The third argument is the function we want to apply to each grouping of the
  data. We had to define our own short function here: each subset of the data
  gets stored in `x`, the first argument of our function. This is an anonymous
  function: we haven't defined it elsewhere, and it has no name. It only exists
  in the scope of our call to `ddply`.

What if we want a different type of output data structure?:

```{r}
dlply(
 .data = calcGDP(gapminder),
 .variables = "continent",
 .fun = function(x) mean(x$gdp)
)
```

We called the same function again, but changed the second letter to an `l`, so
the output was returned as a list.

We can specify multiple columns to group by:

``` {r}
ddply(
 .data = calcGDP(gapminder),
 .variables = c("continent", "year"),
 .fun = function(x) mean(x$gdp)
)
```

```{r}
daply(
 .data = calcGDP(gapminder),
 .variables = c("continent", "year"),
 .fun = function(x) mean(x$gdp)
)
```

You can use these functions in place of `for` loops (and its usually faster to
do so): just write the body of the for loop in the anonymous function:

```{r}
d_ply(
  .data=gapminder,
  .variables = "continent",
  .fun = function(x) {
    meanGDPperCap <- mean(x$gdpPercap)
    print(paste(
      "The mean GDP per capita for", unique(x$continent),
      "is", format(meanGDPperCap, big.mark=",")
   ))
  }
)
```

## dplyr

Manipulation of dataframes means many things to many researchers, we often select certain observations (rows) or variables (columns), we often group the data by a certain variable(s), or we even calculate summary statistic. We can do these operations using the normal base R operations:


~~~{.r}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa", "gdpPercap"])
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 2193.755

~~~



~~~{.r}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas", "gdpPercap"])
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 7136.11

~~~



~~~{.r}
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", "gdpPercap"])
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 7902.15

~~~

But this isn't very *nice* because there is a fair bit of repetition. Repeating yourself will cost you time, both now and later, and potentially introduce some nasty bugs.

#### The `dplyr` package

Luckily, the [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf) package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating dataframes in a way that will reduce the above repetition, reduce the probability of making errors, and probably even save you some typing. As an added bonus, you might even find the `dplyr` grammar easier to read.

Here we're going to cover 6 of the most commonly used functions as well as using pipes (`%>%`) to combine them. 

1. `select()`
2. `filter()`
3. `group_by()`
4. `summarize()`
5. `mutate()`

If you have have not installed this package earlier, please do so:


~~~{.r}
install.packages('dplyr')
~~~

Now let's load the package:


~~~{.r}
library(dplyr)
~~~

#### Using select()

If, for example, we wanted to move forward with only a few of the variables in our dataframe we could use the `select()` function. This will keep only the variables you select.


~~~{.r}
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder,year,country,gdpPercap)
~~~

If we open up `year_country_gdp` we'll see that it only contains the year, country and gdpPercap. Above we used 'normal' grammar, but the strengths of `dplyr` lie in combining several functions using pipes. Since the pipes grammar is unlike anything we've seen in R before, let's repeat what we've done above using pipes.


~~~{.r}
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year,country,gdpPercap)
~~~

To help you understand why we wrote that in that way, let's walk through it step by step. First we summon the gapminder dataframe and pass it on, using the pipe symbol `%>%`, to the next step which is the `select()` function. In this case we don't specify which data object we use in the `select()` function since in gets that from the previous pipe. **Fun Fact**: There is a good chance you have encountered pipes before in the shell. In R, a pipe symbol is `%>%` while in the shell it is `|` but the concept is the same!

#### Using filter()

If we now wanted to move forward with the above, but only with European countries, we can combine `select` and `filter`


~~~{.r}
year_country_gdp_euro <- gapminder %>%
    filter(continent=="Europe") %>%
    select(year,country,gdpPercap)
~~~

> #### Challenge 1 {.challenge}
>
> Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that will produce a dataframe that has the African values for `lifeExp`, `country` and `year`, but not for other Continents. 
>How many rows does your dataframe have and why?
>


As with last time, first we pass the gapminder dataframe to the `filter()` function, then we pass the filtered version of the gapminder dataframe to the `select()` function. **Note:** The order of operations is very important in this case. If we used 'select' first, filter would not be able to find the variable continent since we would have removed it in the previous step.

#### Using group_by() and summarize()

Now, we were supposed to be reducing the error prone repetitiveness of what can be done with base R, but up to now we haven't done that since we would have to repeat the above for each continent. Instead of `filter()`, which will only pass observations that meet your criteria (in the above: `continent=="Europe"`), we can use `group_by()`, which will essentially use every unique criteria that you could have used in filter.

You will notice that the structure of the dataframe where we used `group_by()` (`grouped_df`) is not the same as the original `gapminder` (`data.frame`). A `grouped_df` can be thought of as a `list` where each item in the `list`is a `data.frame` which contains only the rows that correspond to the a particular value `continent` (at least in the example above)

#### Using summarize()

The above was a bit on the uneventful side because `group_by()` much more exciting in conjunction with `summarize()`. This will allow use to create new variable(s) by using functions that repeat for each of the continent-specific data frames. That is to say, using the `group_by()` function, we split our original dataframe into multiple pieces, then we can run functions (e.g. `mean()` or `sd()`) within `summarize()`.


~~~{.r}
gdp_bycontinents <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
~~~

That allowed us to calculate the mean gdpPercap for each continent, but it gets even better.

The function `group_by()` allows us to group by multiple variables. Let's group by `year` and `continent`



~~~{.r}
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
~~~

That is already quite powerful, but it gets even better! You're not limited to defining 1 new variable in `summarize()`.


~~~{.r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop=mean(pop),
              sd_pop=sd(pop))
~~~

#### Using mutate()

We can also create new variables prior to (or even after) summarizing information using `mutate()`.

~~~{.r}
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion=gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop=mean(pop),
              sd_pop=sd(pop),
              mean_pop=mean(pop),
              sd_pop=sd(pop))
~~~

Researchers often want to manipulate their data from the 'wide' to the 'long' format, or vice-versa. The 'long' format is where:

 - each column is a variable
 - each row is an observation

In the 'long' format, you usually have 1 column for the observed variable and the other columns are ID variables.


For the 'wide' format each row is often a site/subject/patient and you have multiple observation variables containing the same type of data. These can be either repeated observations over time, or observation of multiple variables (or a mix of both). You may find data input may be simpler or some other applications may prefer the 'wide' format. However, many of `R`'s functions have been designed assuming you have 'long' format data. This tutorial will help you efficiently transform your data regardless of original format.

These data formats mainly affect readability. For humans, the wide format is often more intuitive since we can often see more of the data on the screen due to it's shape. However, the long format is more machine readable and is closer to the formating of databases. The ID variables in our dataframes are similar to the fields in a database and observed variables are like the database values.

###Getting started
First install the packages if you haven't already done so (you probably installed dplyr in the previous lesson):

~~~{.r}
#install.packages("tidyr")
#install.packages("dplyr")
~~~

Load the packages

~~~{.r}
library("tidyr")
library("dplyr")
~~~

First, lets look at the structure of our original gapminder dataframe:

~~~{.r}
str(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : chr  "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ pop      : num  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 ...
 $ continent: chr  "Asia" "Asia" "Asia" "Asia" ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...

> Is gapminder a purely long, purely wide, or some intermediate format?
>

Sometimes, as with the gapminder dataset, we have multiple types of observed data. It is somewhere in between the purely 'long' and 'wide' data formats. We have 3 "ID variables" (`continent`, `country`, `year`) and 3 "Observation variables" (`pop`,`lifeExp`,`gdpPercap`). I usually prefer my data in this intermediate format in most cases despite not having ALL observations in 1 column given that all 3 observation variables have different units. There are few operations that would need us to stretch out this dataframe any longer (i.e. 4 ID variables and 1 Observation variable).

While using many of the functions in R, which are often vector based, you usually do not want to do mathematical operations on values with different units. For example, using the purely long format, a single mean for all of the values of population, life expectancy, and GDP would not be meaningful since it would return the mean of values with 3 incompatible units. The solution is that we first manipulate the data either by grouping (see the lesson on `dplyr`), or we change the structure of the dataframe.
**Note:** Some plotting functions in R actually work better in the wide format data.

#### From wide to long format with gather()
Until now, we've been using the nicely formatted original gapminder dataset, but 'real' data (i.e. our own research data) will never be so well organized. Here let's start with the wide format version of the gapminder dataset.


~~~{.r}
str(gap_wide)

The first step towards getting our nice intermediate data format is to first convert from the wide to the long format. The `tidyr` function `gather()` will 'gather' your observation variables into a single variable.


~~~{.r}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% gather(obstype_year,obs_values,starts_with('pop'),starts_with('lifeExp'),starts_with('gdpPercap'))
str(gap_long)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	5112 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ continent   : chr  "Africa" "Africa" "Africa" "Africa" ...
 $ country     : chr  "Algeria" "Angola" "Benin" "Botswana" ...
 $ obstype_year: Factor w/ 36 levels "pop_1952","pop_1957",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ obs_values  : num  9279525 4232095 1738315 442308 4469979 ...

~~~

Here we have used piping syntax which is similar to what we were doing in the previous lesson with dplyr. In fact, these are compatible and you can use a mix of tidyr and dplyr functions by piping them together

Inside `gather()` we first name the new column for the new ID variable (`obstype_year`), the name for the new amalgamated observation variable (`obs_value`), then the names of the old observation variable. We could have typed out all the observation variables, but as in the `select()` function (see `dplyr` lesson), we can use the `starts_with()` argument to select all variables that starts with the desired character sring. Gather also allows the alternative syntax of using the `-` symbol to identify which variables are not to be gathered (i.e. ID variables)

gap_long <- gap_wide %>% gather(obstype_year,obs_values,-continent,-country)

~~~

That may seem trivial with this particular dataframe, but sometimes you have 1 ID variable and 40 Observation variables with irregular variables names. The flexibility is a huge time saver!


Now `obstype_year` actually contains 2 pieces of information, the observation type (`pop`,`lifeExp`, or `gdpPercap`) and the `year`. We can use the `separate()` function to split the character strings into multiple variables


~~~{.r}
gap_long <- gap_long %>% separate(obstype_year,into=c('obs_type','year'),sep="_")
gap_long$year <- as.integer(gap_long$year)
~~~

#### From long to intermediate format with spread()
Now just to double-check our work, let's use the opposite of `gather()` to spread our observation variables back out with the aptly named `spread()`. We can then spread our `gap_long()` to the original intermediate format or the widest format. Let's start with the intermediate format.


~~~{.r}
gap_normal <- gap_long %>% spread(obs_type,obs_values)
dim(gap_normal)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 1704    6

~~~



~~~{.r}
dim(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 1704    6

~~~



~~~{.r}
names(gap_normal)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "continent" "country"   "year"      "gdpPercap" "lifeExp"   "pop"      

~~~



~~~{.r}
names(gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "country"   "year"      "pop"       "continent" "lifeExp"   "gdpPercap"

~~~

Now we've got an intermediate dataframe `gap_normal` with the same dimensions as the original `gapminder`, but the order of the variables is different. Let's fix that before checking if they are `identical()`.


~~~{.r}
gap_normal <- gap_normal[,names(gapminder)]
identical(gap_normal,gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] FALSE

~~~



~~~{.r}
head(gap_normal)
~~~



~~~{.output}
  country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Algeria 1952  9279525    Africa  43.077  2449.008
2 Algeria 1957 10270856    Africa  45.685  3013.976
3 Algeria 1962 11000948    Africa  48.303  2550.817
4 Algeria 1967 12760499    Africa  51.407  3246.992
5 Algeria 1972 14760787    Africa  54.518  4182.664
6 Algeria 1977 17152804    Africa  58.014  4910.417

head(gapminder)

6 Afghanistan 1977 14880372      Asia  38.438  786.1134

~~~

We're almost there, the original was sorted by `country`, `continent`, then `year`.


~~~{.r}
gap_normal <- gap_normal %>% arrange(country,continent,year)
identical(gap_normal,gapminder)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] TRUE

~~~

That's great! We've gone from the longest format back to the intermediate and we didn't introduce any errors in our code.

Now lets convert the long all the way back to the wide. In the wide format, we will keep country and continent as ID variables and spread the observations across the 3 metrics (`pop`,`lifeExp`,`gdpPercap`) and time (`year`). First we need to create appropriate labels for all our new variables (time*metric combinations) and we also need to unify our ID variables to simplify the process of defining `gap_wide`


~~~{.r}
gap_temp <- gap_long %>% unite(var_ID,continent,country,sep="_")
str(gap_temp)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	5112 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ var_ID    : chr  "Africa_Algeria" "Africa_Angola" "Africa_Benin" "Africa_Botswana" ...
 $ obs_type  : chr  "gdpPercap" "gdpPercap" "gdpPercap" "gdpPercap" ...
 $ year      : int  1952 1952 1952 1952 1952 1952 1952 1952 1952 1952 ...
 $ obs_values: num  2449 3521 1063 851 543 ...

~~~



~~~{.r}
gap_temp <- gap_long %>%
    unite(ID_var,continent,country,sep="_") %>%
    unite(var_names,obs_type,year,sep="_")
str(gap_temp)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	5112 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ ID_var    : chr  "Africa_Algeria" "Africa_Angola" "Africa_Benin" "Africa_Botswana" ...
 $ var_names : chr  "gdpPercap_1952" "gdpPercap_1952" "gdpPercap_1952" "gdpPercap_1952" ...
 $ obs_values: num  2449 3521 1063 851 543 ...

~~~

Using `unite()` we now have a single ID variable which is a combination of `continent`,`country`,and we have defined variable names. We're now ready to pipe in `spread()`  


~~~{.r}
gap_wide_new <- gap_long %>% 
    unite(ID_var,continent,country,sep="_") %>%
    unite(var_names,obs_type,year,sep="_") %>%
    spread(var_names,obs_values)
str(gap_wide_new)
~~~

Now we have a great 'wide' format dataframe, but the `ID_var` could be more usable, let's separate it into 2 variables with `separate()`



~~~{.r}
gap_wide_betterID <- separate(gap_wide_new,ID_var,c("continent","country"),sep="_")
gap_wide_betterID <- gap_long %>% 
    unite(ID_var,continent,country,sep="_") %>%
    unite(var_names,obs_type,year,sep="_") %>%
    spread(var_names,obs_values) %>%
    separate(ID_var,c("continent","country"),sep="_")
str(gap_wide_betterID)

## Best practices for writing nice code

#### Make code readable

The most important part of writing code is making it readable and understandable.
You want someone else to be able to pick up your code and be able to understand
what it does: more often than not this someone will be you 6 months down the line,
who will otherwise be cursing past-self.

#### Documentation: tell us what and why, not how

When you first start out, your comments will often describe what a command does,
since you're still learning yourself and it can help to clarify concepts and
remind you later. However, these comments aren't particularly useful later on
when you don't remember what problem your code is trying to solve. Try to also
include comments that tell you *why* you're solving a problem, and *what* problem
that is. The *how* can come after that: it's an implementation detail you ideally
shouldn't have to worry about.

#### Keep your code modular

Our recommendation is that you should separate your functions from your analysis
scripts, and store them in a separate file that you `source` when you open the R
session in your project. This approach is nice because it leaves you with an
uncluttered analysis script, and a repository of useful functions that can be
loaded into any analysis script in your project. It also lets you group related
functions together easily.

#### Break down problem into bite size pieces

When you first start out, problem solving and function writing can be daunting
tasks, and hard to separate from code inexperience. Try to break down your
problem into digestible chunks and worry about the implementation details later:
keep breaking down the problem into smaller and smaller functions until you
reach a point where you can code a solution, and build back up from there.

#### Know that your code is doing the right thing

Make sure to test your functions!

#### Don't repeat yourself

Functions enable easy reuse within a project. If you see blocks of similar
lines of code through your project, those are usually candidates for being
moved into functions.

If your calculations are performed through a series of functions, then the
project becomes more modular and easier to change. This is especially the case
for which a particular input always gives a particular output.

#### Remember to be stylish

Apply consistent style to your code.
