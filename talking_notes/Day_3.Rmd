## Git / Github [Andrew]

### Explain Git and Github

* Git is a version control software for keeping track of changes made to your documents and allowing you to go to earlier versions of them
* Git removes the need for scripts labeled `model1`, `model2`, and so on...
* Github is a website that provides an interface for Git so that you can share and collaborate on projects

Once we have Git working on everyone's computers, we will be able to share the course notes together
