Hi,

My suggestions are work on some multivariate analyses like PCA PCoA RDA.
Give an example of statistics analyses with a not normally distributed data.
How to edit or modify graphs inside an already written function.
How to order datasets to different types of statistic analyses.

And let it free for questions on the road :)
